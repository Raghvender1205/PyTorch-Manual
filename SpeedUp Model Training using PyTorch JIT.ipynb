    "PyTorch JIT `torch.jit` is a nifty feature of PyTorch which is used to implement performant custom module code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've implemented a `SOTA` or `near-SOTA` based neural network, you're very likely building and testing layer architectures from recent research which is'nt event in PyTorch. As these implementations are not `optimized` by PyTorch they are slower than their standard library equivalents.\n",

    "`torch.jit` can be used to enable 2x-3x speedups on `custom module code`.\n",

    "## Eager v/s Graph Execution\n",
    "There are 2 different dormant models of execution in Deep Learning `eager` and `graph`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Framework is said to use `eager execution` if it builds its `computational graph` (set of steps to perform `forward` and `backward` propogation) at runtime. Every `forward` pass through a PyTorch model constructs an `autograd` computational graph; the subsequent call to `backward` then consumes this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that's actually executing the mathematical operations involved is ultimately a C++ or CUDA kernel, but the result of each individual operation is immediately transferred to (and accessible from) the Python process, because the Python process is the `\"intelligent\"`partâ€”it's what's managing the `computational graph` as a whole. This is why debugging in PyTorch is as simple as dropping `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` in the middle of your code.\n",
