    "- Primitive Types like <code>Int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>str</code>\n",
    "- Structural Types like <code>Optional[int]</code> or <code>List[MyClass]</code>\n",
    "- Nominal Types (Classes) like <code>CustomClass</code> (user-defined), <code>torch.tensor</code> (builtin)\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>TSModuleType</code> represents ```torch.nn.Module``` and its subclasses. It is treated differently from <code>TSType</code> because of its type schema is inferred partly from the object instance and partly from the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, instances of ```TSModuleType``` may not follow the same static type schema. <code>TSModuleType</code> cannot be used as a TorchScript type annotation or be composed with ```TSType``` for safety considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meta Types\n",
    "These are so abstract that they are more like type constraints than concrete types.\n",
    "\n",
    "TorchScript currently supports ```Any``` meta type which represents any TorchScript type.\n",
    "### <code>Any</code> type\n",
    "The ```Any``` type has no type constraints so there is no type-checking on ```Any```. As such it can be bound to any Python or TorchScript data types like ```int```, ```tuple```.\n",

    "## TorchScript Module Class\n",
    "\n",
    "```TSModuleType``` is a special class type that is inferred from object instances that are created outside TorchScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "```TSModuleType``` is named by the Python class of the ```object``` instance. The ```__init__()``` method of the Python class is not considered a TorchScript method, so it does not comply with TorchScript's type-checking rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Type schema of the module instance class is constructed directly from an instance object (created outside the scope of TorchScript) rather than inferred from ```__init__()``` like custom classes. It is possible that two objects of the same instance class type follow two different type schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, ```TSModuleType``` is not really a static type. Therefore, for type safety considerations, ```TSModuleType``` cannot be used in a TorchScript type annotation or be composed with ```TSType```.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module Instance Class\n",
    "\n",
    "TorchScript module type represents the type schema of a user-defined by PyTorch module instance. When scripting a PyTorch module, the module object is always created outside TorchScript (i.e passed in as parameter to ```forward```).\n",

    "#### Where\n",
    "- ```forward()``` and other methods decorated with ```@torch.jit.export``` must be compilable to TorchScript IR and subject to TorchScript's type checking rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Custom classes, only the ```forward``` method and other methods decorated with ```@torch.jit.export``` of the module type need to be compilable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notably ```__init__()``` is not considered a TorchScript method. Module Type Constructors cannot be invoked within the scope of TorchScript.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Example 1\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The ```TestModule``` instance created outside the scope of TorchScript.\n",
    "2. ```__init__()``` is not considered a TorchScript method so it does not have to be annotated and can contain arbitrary Python code. In addition, the ```__init__()``` method of an instance class cannot be invoked in TorchScript code because the ```TestModule```instances are instantiated in Python\n",
    "3. In this Example, ```TestModule(2.0)``` and ```TestModule(2)``` create two instances with different types for its data attributes. ```self.x```is of type ```float``` for ```TestModule(2.0)```, whereas ```self.y``` is of type ```int``` for ```TestModule(2.0)```.\n",
    "4. TorchScript automatically compiles other methods like ```mul()``` invoked by methods annotated via ```@torch.jit.export``` or ```forward()``` methods.\n",
